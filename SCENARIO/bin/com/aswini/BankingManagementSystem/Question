🏦 OOPs Scenario Question

Scenario:

Design a Banking Management System using all OOP principles.

Requirements:

Abstraction

Create an abstract class BankAccount with:

Private fields → accountNo, holderName, balance (Data Hiding).

Constructor to initialize details (Constructor).

Getter/Setter methods (Encapsulation).

Abstract methods:

deposit(double amount)

withdraw(double amount)

Inheritance

Create subclasses:

SavingsAccount → extra field interestRate.

CurrentAccount → extra field overdraftLimit.

Both must extend BankAccount.

Polymorphism

Override methods deposit() and withdraw() differently:

SavingsAccount → doesn’t allow balance below zero.

CurrentAccount → allows overdraft up to a limit.

Use method overriding to achieve polymorphism.

Encapsulation + Data Hiding

Keep all fields private.

Access them only through getters/setters.

Constructor

Use constructors to set initial account values in BankAccount, SavingsAccount, and CurrentAccount.

BankDemo (Main Class)

Create objects using polymorphism:

BankAccount acc1 = new SavingsAccount(...);
BankAccount acc2 = new CurrentAccount(...);


Perform deposits, withdrawals, and print account details.

Show how polymorphism executes the correct version of withdraw()/deposit().

🔑 Hints (Not Code, Just Guidance)

Think of BankAccount like a blueprint (you cannot open a generic account, must be Savings or Current).

Encapsulation = private fields with getters/setters.

Data Hiding = user cannot directly change balance.

Constructor = when you open an account, you must provide details.

Inheritance = Savings and Current accounts inherit from BankAccount.

Polymorphism = withdraw() behaves differently depending on object type.

Abstraction = force every account type to implement deposit() and withdraw().

📌 Final Assignment Question

👉 "Create a Banking System using OOPs where BankAccount is an abstract class with private fields and constructors, SavingsAccount and CurrentAccount are subclasses, and deposit/withdraw work differently. Demonstrate Encapsulation, Data Hiding, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Constructor, and Abstraction in one program with a BankDemo class."
