🚦 Scenario 1: Traffic Flow Simulation (Industry-Style)
Scenario

You are tasked to simulate city traffic at a single intersection. The simulation must handle:

Multiple vehicles of different types.

A traffic light system that controls when vehicles move.

Rules: Vehicles stop at red, wait at yellow, move at green.

Your simulation should run for multiple time steps and print the status of each vehicle at each step.

Requirements

Abstract Class – Vehicle

Private fields: id, speed, position.

Constructor initializes id and speed.

Methods:

move() → update position if allowed.

stop() → set speed = 0.

displayStatus() → show VehicleType, ID, Position.

Subclasses

Car (default speed = 10 units/step).

Bus (default speed = 5 units/step).

Bike (default speed = 7 units/step).

TrafficLight

Enum LightState { RED, YELLOW, GREEN }.

Field: currentState.

Method: changeState() → rotate states.

Simulation

Holds list of vehicles and one traffic light.

Runs for n time steps.

At each step:

Print traffic light state.

For each vehicle: decide move/stop.

Print vehicle status.

Hints

Use Polymorphism → Car, Bus, Bike extend Vehicle.

Use Encapsulation → private fields + getters/setters.

Use Abstraction → Vehicle is abstract.

Use Inheritance → Car, Bus, Bike.

Use Enum for TrafficLight state.

Sample Test Cases
✅ Test Case 1: Single Car with RED Light
TrafficLight light = new TrafficLight(LightState.RED);
Car c1 = new Car(1);
c1.move(light);


Expected Output:
Car 1 stopped at position 0 (RED Light)

✅ Test Case 2: Car Moving on GREEN Light
light.changeState(LightState.GREEN);
c1.move(light);


Expected Output:
Car 1 moved to position 10

✅ Test Case 3: Multiple Vehicles, Simulation for 5 Steps
Simulation sim = new Simulation(light);
sim.addVehicle(new Car(1));
sim.addVehicle(new Bus(2));
sim.addVehicle(new Bike(3));
sim.run(5);


Expected Output (sample):

Step 1 → Light: GREEN
Car 1 moved to position 10
Bus 2 moved to position 5
Bike 3 moved to position 7

Step 2 → Light: GREEN
Car 1 moved to position 20
Bus 2 moved to position 10
Bike 3 moved to position 14

Step 3 → Light: YELLOW
Car 1 stopped at position 20
Bus 2 stopped at position 10
Bike 3 stopped at position 14

Step 4 → Light: RED
All vehicles stopped.

Step 5 → Light: GREEN
Vehicles continue moving...
